**Vehicle Maintenance AI** is a robust machine learning application designed to predict whether a vehicle requires maintenance based on various telemetry and usage factors. By analyzing historical data and current vehicle state, it helps fleet managers and individual owners anticipate service needs before failure occurs.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Predictive Intelligence:** Leverages a Logistic Regression model trained on 50,000+ vehicle records.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A clean, glassmorphism-inspired Streamlit UI for real-time predictions.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Includes comparison charts showing how your vehicle compares to the dataset average.
- **Automated Pipeline:** Full end-to-end preprocessing pipeline for date engineering and categorical encoding.
- **Transparency:** Built-in prediction confidence visualization.

## � Model Performance

Our current production model (`LogisticRegression`) shows high reliability across multiple metrics:

| Metric | Score |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | 95.1% |
| **Precision** | 96.8% |
| **Recall** | 97.1% |
| **F1-Score** | 96.9% |

*Trained on 50,000 samples with an 80/20 split.*

## 🚀 Quick Start (Run Locally)

### 1. Clone & Navigate
```bash
git clone https://github.com/viruchafale/VEHICLE-MAINTENACE-AI.git
cd VEHICLE-MAINTENACE-AI
```

### 2. Prepare Environment
We recommend using a virtual environment to keep your system clean:
```bash
# Create and activate venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Launch Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
> The dashboard will automatically open at **`http://localhost:8501`**.

## � Advanced Usage

### Re-running the Pipeline
To clean the raw data and generate a fresh `vehicle_maintenance_cleaned.csv`:
```bash
python train.py
```

### Experimentation
Explore the training logic or test new models via Jupyter:
```bash
python -m notebook notebooks/new.ipynb
```
